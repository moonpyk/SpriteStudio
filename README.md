# SpriteGenerator

Initial awesomeness has been found at : [http://spritegenerator.codeplex.com/](http://spritegenerator.codeplex.com/)

All kudos to **csigusz** the original author.

# Changes 

The code has been refactored to follow MS code style guidelines (say ReSharper ones). The UI has been updated to be more responsive and non-blocking when working with large amount of files.


# Future plans
 * Keep in sync with the eventual modifications the original author will do. The original work is based on complex research articles about image placement. Relying on complex O-Tree algorithms which I'm not yet comfortable with.
 * Extract a nice library from that work, making possible to use the code anywhere.
 * Add more options to customize the generated css.
 * Give possibility to output SASS/SCSS, Less CSS-preprocessors formats.
 * Make the library able to use multicore machines power with TPL.
 * New UI for better productivity.
 * GTK# UI for Mono Users. **?**
 * Visual Studio integration **?**
